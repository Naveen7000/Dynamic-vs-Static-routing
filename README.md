# Dynamic-vs-Static-routing
In this project, we'll concentrate on the differences between the static and dynamic routing protocols, including Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Distance Vector Protocol (DV), and Link State Protocol (LS). These routing methods are described in detail later in this study. Within small and big topologies, we'll look at traits including throughput, traffic routing, and packet loss. We will collect simulation results for the selected routing protocols using NS2, Cisco Packet Tracer then compare performance to identify the optimum routing protocol for a specific network layout.
